# NYAGI-CADUS:Computer Assisted Diagnostic Ultrasound-2025

CADUS is an innovative mobile application developed as part of the NYAGI Project, designed to enhance ultrasound interpretation in underserved communities worldwide.

## Project Overview

CADUS utilizes machine learning and computer vision technologies to analyze ultrasound footage in real-time. The app alerts users to potential anomalies or areas of concern in ultrasound images, providing guidance on when to seek professional medical evaluation. By enabling easy access to health assessment support in remote areas, CADUS aims to bridge the gap in healthcare services for vulnerable populations in low income countries.

## Key Features
* Real-time analysis of ultrasound imaging
* Offline capability for use in remote areas
* User-friendly interface for healthcare workers
* Alerts for potential anomalies in ultrasound images
* Guidance for seeking professional medical evaluation

In order to run this app, you need to specify a location for Gradle in your `local.properties` file. An example of what should be included in `local.properties` is found in `local.properies.example`.

## Background

CADUS is an ongoing project developed by the 2024 and 2025 capstone teams at CU Boulder. It is part of the larger NYAGI Project, a non-profit organization dedicated to saving mothers' and babies' lives through ultrasound education in underserved communities.

## Mission

Our mission is to empower local healthcare workers in resource-poor areas with accelerated, low-cost ultrasound training, ultimately improving prenatal and emergency care in these regions.
